### Patch Changes

- d67b176: Fix a collaboration crash where a peer's block selection unmounted the editor.

  `mergeBlockDecorationAttributes` in `@input/pen-react` turned a block decoration's attribute bag into props on the block host without the SEC2 skip that `applyElementAttributes` applies to inline decorations. `@input/pen-multiplayer` puts a `style` attribute on remote presence decorations, so a peer selecting a block sent a CSS string into a React `style` prop and React threw out of the commit phase, taking the editor's root with it. The React helper now skips `/^on/i`, `style`, and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, the last of which crashed the same way and is a markup sink only a React prop can reach. Dropping `style` also keeps RI1's `unicode-bidi: isolate` on the block host. `createRemotePresenceAttributes` no longer emits the `style` attribute that every conforming renderer discarded: style presence through `data-user-id`, and peer caret colour still comes from `RemoteCursorState.user.color`.

- d67b176: Show collaborators inside tables.

  A peer editing a table was invisible. `buildLocalAwarenessState` only recognised text and block selections, so a `CellSelection` fell through to `{ cursor: null, selection: null }` and nothing was published — and nothing downstream knew cells existed either, since `RemoteSelectionState` had no cell member.

  Cell selections now travel as `{ kind: "cell", blockId, anchor, head, clock }` with `{ row, col }` endpoints and no cursor: a grid cell is the smallest region this presence names, so there is no caret to place, and coordinates rather than anchors match AS3's structural treatment of the local cell selection. COL2 validates them against the live grid — a cell on a block that holds no grid, or a row or column outside it, is rejected at ingest with the new `out-of-range-cell` reason — and resolve re-reads the grid on every commit so a peer whose rows were deleted under them clamps onto a live cell instead of vanishing.

  `@input/pen-react`'s table renderer marks the occupied cells with `data-pen-multiplayer-cell-selection`, the peer's head cell with `data-pen-multiplayer-cell-head`, and sets the caret overlay's `--pen-peer-color` on each. Because these come from the renderer rather than a presence decoration, they can carry a colour at all: SEC2 drops `style` from decoration attributes, so presence decorations emit none and every other surface is coloured from `data-user-id`. Hosts rendering their own grid can resolve the same mapping with `resolveRemoteCellPresence`, new on `@input/pen-dom/utils/remoteCellSelection` and re-exported from `@input/pen-react`.

  Both `RemoteSelectionState` and `PresenceRejectionReason` gain a member, so an exhaustive `switch` over either needs a new arm.

- 2f9bbe2: Fix soft breaks rendering as spaces, so a `\n` in a block's text shows up as a line break.

  `pen.insertLineBreak` (Shift+Enter) stores a `\n` in the block's own text, and the markdown ingest keeps single newlines inside a paragraph. Nothing rendered them: text entry surfaces inherited CSS's initial `white-space: normal`, so the browser collapsed every stored newline — and every run of repeated spaces — into a single space. The character was still in the document, still counted by undo and delete, and still exported, but it was invisible on screen and the caret would not move onto it. AI writing showed this most sharply, because the streaming preview renders on a surface that already set `pre-wrap`: text appeared with its line breaks while it streamed and lost them the moment it was applied.

  `white-space: pre-wrap` is now a library-authored inline style on the inline content host and on every table cell content host, in all three renderers, alongside RI1's `unicode-bidi: isolate` and for the same reason. This is correctness rather than taste and is deliberately not overridable by host CSS: a surface that renders its own stored characters incorrectly is not a theme, and HOST6 requires an editor with no host stylesheet to be functional.

  `pre-wrap` honors an interior newline but gives a trailing one no line box, so a field whose text ends with `\n` also gets a trailing `<br>`, maintained by both reconcile paths. Like the empty-block placeholder it is marked (`data-pen-trailing-break`) and contributes no logical length and no logical text, so offset mapping and the DOM/`Y.Text` watchdog read straight through it and it never becomes document content.

  Two consequences for hosts. Ordinary host CSS setting `white-space` on `[data-pen-inline-content]` or a cell content host no longer wins, because an inline style beats a stylesheet rule; a host that genuinely needs another value — a code block wanting `white-space: pre` with horizontal scroll is the real case — needs `!important`. And a field whose text ends with `\n` now has one more child element, which host selectors like `:last-child` or `> *` and any host code walking the surface's children will see.

- d67b176: Fix the slash menu inserting the wrong block type.

  `Pen.SlashMenu.List` in auto mode regrouped `items` by `display.group` and handed each option a counter that restarted from the grouped order, while `confirm(index)`, `select(index)`, and `selectedIndex` all index the flat `items` array from `useSlashMenu`. Any schema whose groups are not contiguous in registration order made the two orders disagree, and the default schema is one: it registers `bulletListItem`, `numberedListItem`, and `checkListItem` between `heading` and `codeBlock`, so `basic` resumes after `lists` has started. Choosing Code Block inserted a bullet list, Divider inserted a numbered list, and Quote inserted an image. Arrow-key navigation moved the active option through the flat order too, so the highlight jumped around the rendered list and `aria-activedescendant` named an option other than the visible one, against AX3.

  `useSlashMenu` now returns items already partitioned by group, so the order the menu navigates is the order it renders, and the query path groups after its relevance sort so the closest match stays at index 0. The list builds group headings by breaking consecutive runs instead of regrouping, which means every option carries its real index in `items` and a list that ever saw an ungrouped array would repeat a heading rather than resolve the wrong block.

  The ordering itself is DOM-free and now ships from `@input/pen-core` as `orderSlashMenuItemsByGroup` and `slashMenuGroupOf`, next to `shouldShowBlockInDefaultMenus` and the `allBlockDisplays()` registry it reorders, so a second renderer's slash menu inherits the invariant instead of reimplementing it (API6).

- 49ff006: Fix the slash menu leaving its trigger text in the document.

  Confirming an entry only deleted the trigger when the block held a lone `/`. Any query took the sibling-insert branch instead, so picking Table after typing `/ta` left a `/ta` paragraph above the new table — the block the author was converting survived as litter. It was also AX3-visible: `getSlashTarget` matches any block whose text starts with `/`, so the listbox reopened as soon as selection returned to the leftover paragraph.

  `confirm` now deletes the whole trigger range — `/` and query together, read from the live document — in the same undo group that installs the chosen block, and decides its shape from what is left over: nothing left means the trigger was the whole block, so the block is converted in place; text left over (a caret parked mid-word, or a confirm with no trigger, which is how a host-supplied `SlashMenu.Input` drives the hook) keeps its block and inserts the chosen type as a sibling.
